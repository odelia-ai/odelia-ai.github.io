### Cookies

We use cookies. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your end device when you access the site. They cannot transfer viruses or malware to your computer, but they do contain information that enables the user to be identified.

A distinction must be made between transient cookies, which are deleted as soon as your browser is closed, and persistent cookies, which are stored beyond the respective session and recognize you the next time you visit the website.

In terms of function, a distinction must be made between technically necessary and non-essential cookies.

Technically necessary cookies
Here you will find all cookies that are required for the operation of our website and its functions (technically necessary cookies). These are usually set in response to an action you have taken. These include registration, login or settings such as language or cookie preferences. It is possible to deactivate these cookies in the browser. In this case, we can no longer guarantee that our website will function properly.

Cookies that are not technically necessary
Here you will find all cookies that are not absolutely necessary for the operation of our website and its functions (technically unnecessary cookies). The use of such cookies constitutes data processing that is only permitted with your active consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR). This also applies to the transfer of your personal data to third parties.

### Hosting
Our host collects the following data transmitted by your browser in log files:

IP address, the address of the previously visited website (referrer request header), date and time of the request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status code, amount of data transferred, website from which the request comes and information about the browser and operating system.

This is necessary to display our website and to ensure stability and security. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.

There is no tracking and we do not have direct access to this data, but only receive an anonymized, statistical summary. This includes the address of the previously visited page, the frequency of each page accessed and the number of unique visitors. We do not merge this data with other data.

We use the following hoster for the provision of our website:

```
GitHub Inc.
88 Colin P Kelly Jr St
San Francisco, CA 94107
United States
```

This is the recipient of your personal data. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR in not having to maintain a server on our premises ourselves. Server location is USA.

Further information on objection and removal options vis-à-vis GitHub can be found at: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages

You have the right to object to the processing. Whether the objection is successful must be determined as part of a balancing of interests.

The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing no longer applies.

The processing of the data specified in this section is not required by law or contract. The functionality of the website is not guaranteed without the processing.

GitHub has implemented compliance measures for international data transfers. These apply to all global activities where GitHub processes personal data of natural persons in the EU. These measures are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).

### Google Analytics 4

If you have given your consent, Google Analytics 4, a web analysis service of Google LLC, is used on this website. The controller for users in the EU/EEA and Switzerland is Google Ireland Limited, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland ("Google").

Google Analytics uses cookies that enable your use of our website to be analyzed. The information collected by the cookies about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.

In Google Analytics 4, the anonymization of IP addresses is activated by default. Due to IP anonymization, your IP address will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. According to Google, the IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.
During your visit to the website, your user behavior is recorded in the form of "events". Events can be

- Page views
- First visit to the website
- Start of the session
- Websites visited
- Your "click path", interaction with the website
- Scrolls (whenever a user scrolls to the end of the page (90%))
- Clicks on external links
- Internal search queries
- Interaction with videos
- file downloads
- Viewed / clicked ads
- language setting
  
Also recorded:

- Your approximate location (region)
- Date and time of your visit
- Your IP address (in abbreviated form)
- Technical information about your browser and the end devices you use (e.g. language setting, screen resolution)
- your internet provider
- the referrer URL (via which website/advertising medium you came to this website)

On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website and to compile reports on website activity. The reports provided by Google Analytics are used to analyze the performance of our website.

Recipients of the data are/may be

Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA
Alphabet Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA
```

For the USA, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision on July 10, 2023. Google LLC is certified under the EU-US Privacy Framework. Since Google servers are distributed worldwide and a transfer to third countries (for example to Singapore) cannot be completely ruled out, we have also concluded the EU standard contractual clauses with the provider.

The data sent by us and linked to cookies is automatically deleted after 2 [OR: 14 months]. The maximum lifespan of Google Analytics cookies is 2 years. Data whose retention period has been reached is automatically deleted once a month.

The legal basis for this data processing is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 sentence 1 TTDSG.

You can also prevent the storage of cookies from the outset by setting your browser software accordingly. However, if you configure your browser to reject all cookies, this may limit the functionality of this and other websites. You can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) and from processing this data by Google by
