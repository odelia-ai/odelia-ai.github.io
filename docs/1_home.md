# The Project

Open Source Swarm Learning
Revolutionizing Medical AI
With Swarm Learning
Empowering secure and collaborative AI-driven healthcare through swarm learning, revolutionizing diagnostics, and fostering global cooperation

ODELIA Is Transforming Healthcare By Establishing A First-Of-Its-Kind Pan-European Open Source Swarm Learning Network For Medical AI

Our focus is on harnessing AI for breast cancer detection in MRI screenings, serving as a model for further advancements using swarm learning. We will accelerate AI development, improve diagnostic performance, and promote generalizable solutions, while also protecting privacy and fostering collaboration, ultimately contributing to better healthcare outcomes for European patients.
